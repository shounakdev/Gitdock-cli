# Gitdock

GitDock CLI is the command-line interface for GitDock, a modern version control system inspired by Git — rebuilt from scratch to support fine-grained permissions, flexible storage backends, and organization-wide collaboration.

This CLI allows developers to initialize, push, pull, branch, and manage repositories locally or on cloud/networked drives — all while integrating with GitDock's RBAC system and web dashboard.

## Features

- 🆕 `gitdock init` – Initialize a new GitDock repository
- ⬆️ `gitdock push` – Push changes to remote storage (Drive, OneDrive, Network)
- ⬇️ `gitdock pull` – Pull updates from remote
- 🌿 `gitdock branch` – Create, switch, or list branches
- 🔒 RBAC integrated – Auth via GitDock Web Dashboard
- 🗃️ Storage-aware – Push to Google Drive, OneDrive, or mounted drives
- 🧠 Smart diffs and change tracking

> GitDock CLI is built in **Go** for performance, simplicity, and cross-platform support.
